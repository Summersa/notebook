<b>Second Look at Jupyter:</b>

The first objective was to fix the issue I posted. Issue 1214 (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1214). 
This issue was to make it so you could toggle the header like you could on every other page besides the edit page. 
As you can see I got to communicate with a developer on jupyter when trying to merge my pull request in. He gave me
sound advice and I followed suit for it to eventually become merged (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1215).
Merging and feeling like I contributed to the project felt fantastic, I felt like I part of me would always be in that 
project for all to see. It was a good feeling. Here is a picture below to visualize my changes.
